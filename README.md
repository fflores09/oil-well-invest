📌 Project Overview
This project aimed to identify the most profitable regions for developing 200 new oil wells. By leveraging predictive modeling and financial metrics, the study provides a data-driven foundation for strategic investment decisions, balancing potential gains against inherent geological risks.

🚀 Key Features
Predictive Analysis: Developed a model to estimate oil reserve volumes and regional productivity.

Financial Modeling: Conducted an in-depth analysis of key metrics, including projected profits and expected returns (ROI) for each candidate region.

Risk Assessment: Implemented statistical techniques (such as Bootstrapping) to estimate the probability of losses and ensure investment security.

📊 Technical Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy (for linear regression and statistical modeling).

Concepts: Linear Regression, Bootstrapping, Profit Calculation, Risk Analysis.

📈 Results & Impact
Optimal Selection: Successfully identified the top-performing region based on the highest Expected Return and the lowest risk profile.

Data-Driven Strategy: Provided a robust framework that justifies the allocation of capital for 200 wells, ensuring the selection is backed by predictive accuracy rather than just historical averages.

Profit Optimization: The model prioritized regions that met the minimum threshold for break-even, significantly reducing the margin of error in site selection.
